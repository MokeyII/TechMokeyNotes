 IPAM stands for IP Address Management. It is a crucial component of network management that involves the planning, tracking, and managing of IP address spaces within a network. IPAM helps network administrators ensure that IP addresses are efficiently allocated, utilized, and maintained, preventing issues such as IP address conflicts and ensuring that there are enough IP addresses available for all devices on the network.

IPAM typically integrates with other [[Efforts/Ongoing/TheTechMokey/Networking/Networking]] services such as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System) to provide a comprehensive DDI ([[DNS]], [[DHCP]], and [[IPAM]]) solution. This integration allows for automated and streamlined management of IP addresses, making it easier to handle tasks such as assigning IP addresses to devices, updating DNS records, and managing DHCP leases.

Services like Infoblox offer DDI solutions that include IPAM, providing tools and features to simplify and enhance the management of IP address spaces in complex network environments.
