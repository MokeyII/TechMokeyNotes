The [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/), or the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers**, is a professional association dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. It is one of the world's largest technical professional organizations, with a wide range of activities including publishing technical literature, organizing conferences, and developing standards.

### Key Points About IEEE:

1. **History and Formation**:
    
    - The IEEE was formed in 1963 through the merger of two older organizations: the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), founded in 1884, and the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), founded in 1912.
    - The merger combined the strengths of both organizations, focusing on electrical engineering and radio engineering, respectively.
2. **Membership**:
    
    - IEEE has over 400,000 members in more than 160 countries, making it a truly global organization.
    - Members include engineers, scientists, and allied professionals who work in various fields of technology and engineering.
3. **Publications and Conferences**:
    
    - IEEE publishes a significant portion of the world's technical literature in electrical engineering, computer science, and electronics.
    - It organizes numerous conferences, workshops, and symposia around the world, providing platforms for professionals to share their research and innovations.
4. **Standards Development**:
    
    - One of IEEE's most important roles is in the development of technical standards. These standards ensure interoperability, safety, and quality across various technologies and industries.
    - Notable standards developed by IEEE include the IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless [[Efforts/Ongoing/TheTechMokey/Networking/Networking]] ([[Wi-Fi]]), IEEE 802.3 standards for Ethernet, and many others.
5. **Technical Societies and Councils**:
    
    - IEEE is composed of various technical societies and councils that focus on specific areas of technology. Examples include the IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Communications Society, and IEEE Power & Energy Society.
    - These societies and councils provide specialized resources, conferences, and publications for their respective fields.
6. **Educational and Professional Development**:
    
    - IEEE offers a wide range of educational resources, including online courses, certifications, and continuing education programs.
    - It also provides career development resources, [[Efforts/Ongoing/TheTechMokey/Networking/Networking]] opportunities, and awards to recognize outstanding contributions to the field.
7. **Mission and Vision**:
    
    - IEEE's mission is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.
    - Its vision is to be essential to the global technical community and to technical professionals everywhere, and to be universally recognized for the contributions of technology and of technical professionals in improving global conditions.

### Summary

The IEEE is a global professional association dedicated to advancing technology through its extensive activities in publishing, conferences, standards development, and educational programs. It plays a crucial role in shaping the future of technology and engineering, benefiting both professionals in the field and society at large.
