Wi-Fi, short for "Wireless Fidelity," is a technology that allows electronic devices to connect to a wireless local area network ([[WLAN]]), typically using radio waves. The term "Wi-Fi" is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, a global non-profit organization that promotes Wi-Fi technology and certifies Wi-Fi products for conformity to certain standards of interoperability.

### Key Points About Wi-Fi:

1. **Wireless Communication**: Wi-Fi enables devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and other electronics to communicate over a wireless network, eliminating the need for physical cables.
    
2. **Standards**: Wi-Fi is based on the [[IEEE]] 802.11 family of standards. These standards define the protocols for implementing wireless local area network ([[WLAN]]) communication in various frequency bands, including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and more recently, 6 GHz.
    
3. **Access Points and Routers**: Wi-Fi networks typically consist of a wireless access point (AP) or router that broadcasts a wireless signal. Devices within range can connect to this signal to access the network and, often, the internet.
    
4. **Security**: Wi-Fi networks can be secured using various encryption methods, such as WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), WPA2, and WPA3, to protect data transmitted over the network from unauthorized access.
    
5. **Range and Speed**: The range and speed of a Wi-Fi network can vary based on the specific 802.11 standard in use, the environment (e.g., walls, interference), and the capabilities of the devices involved. For example, 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) offer higher speeds and better performance compared to older standards like 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4).
    
6. **Applications**: Wi-Fi is used in a wide range of applications, from home and office networks to public hotspots in cafes, airports, and other public places. It is also integral to the functioning of many smart home devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
7. Wi-Fi Security Protocols:

- **WPA2/WPA3**: Modern Wi-Fi networks use WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) or WPA3 to provide robust security. These protocols include mechanisms for both authentication and encryption, ensuring that only authorized clients can connect and that data is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.
  - **802.1X Authentication**: Often used in enterprise Wi-Fi networks, 802.1X provides a framework for authenticating users and devices using a RADIUS server. This method enhances security by requiring credentials (e.g., username and password) or certificates for authentication.

### Summary:

- **[[802.11 Authentication and Association]]** are critical steps in the Wi-Fi connection process, ensuring that only authorized clients can connect to the network and that a logical connection is established for data communication.
- **Authentication** verifies the client's identity, while **Association** establishes the connection parameters and allows data exchange.
- These processes are integrated with modern Wi-Fi security protocols like WPA2 and WPA3 to provide robust security and protect the network and its users.

By ensuring that only authorized devices can connect and that data is securely transmitted, [[802.11 Authentication and Association]] play a vital role in the overall functionality and security of Wi-Fi networks.
### Summary

Wi-Fi is a technology that enables wireless communication between devices over a local area network, based on the [[IEEE]] 802.11 standards. It is widely used for internet access, data transfer, and connecting various electronic devices without the need for physical cables. The Wi-Fi Alliance oversees the certification and promotion of Wi-Fi technology to ensure interoperability and security across different devices and manufacturers.
