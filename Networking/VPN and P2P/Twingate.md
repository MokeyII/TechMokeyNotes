Twingate is a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution that secures access to network resources by implementing a "never trust, always verify" security model. Unlike traditional VPNs that grant broad network access once a user is connected, Twingate provides granular access control by authenticating and authorizing every request for individual resources. It does this by using identity-based access policies, endpoint verification, and continuous monitoring to ensure only authenticated users and devices can access specific resources, regardless of their location.

In Twingate, network connections are encrypted and distributed through secure "connectors" that can be deployed anywhere, including cloud and on-prem environments, making it highly flexible and scalable. This approach reduces attack surfaces, improves performance by minimizing network latency, and provides better security for remote and hybrid workforces.
