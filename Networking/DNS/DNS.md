DNS, or Domain Name System, is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to translate human-readable domain names (likeÂ [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. Essentially, DNS acts as the phonebook of the internet, allowing users to access websites and other resources using easy-to-remember domain names instead of numerical IP addresses.

In the context of the previous conversation, DNS is being configured alongside [[DHCP|DHCP]] (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) on a [[Linux|Linux]]  server using [[ISC DHCP]] and BIND DNS server. This setup includes dynamic updates (DDNS), which allow the [[DHCP|DHCP]] server to automatically update the DNS records when a device receives a new IP address. This ensures that the DNS records are always up-to-date with the current IP addresses assigned by the [[DHCP]] server.

There are many ways to improve [[DNS Security]].
