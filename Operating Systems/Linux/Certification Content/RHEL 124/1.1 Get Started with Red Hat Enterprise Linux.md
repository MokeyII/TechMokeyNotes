# Getting Started with Red Hat Enterprise Linux: A Comprehensive Overview

Welcome to a guide on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Where I'll walk through some of the fundamental concepts that define Linux, open source software, and Red Hat’s unique ecosystem of distributions and community projects. Whether you’re an experienced IT professional or simply exploring what Linux has to offer, this read will give you a solid foundation.

## What Is Linux?

### Objectives

- Understand the purpose of Linux, open source, Linux distributions, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### Why Learn About Linux?

Linux is a fundamental technology in today’s IT world. Many daily online interactions—from browsing websites to processing e-commerce transactions—rely on Linux-based servers. Beyond the internet, Linux powers point-of-sale systems, the global stock markets, smart TVs, in-flight entertainment, and the majority of the world’s top supercomputers. If you’re working in modern data centers, the cloud, or even IoT (Internet of Things), you’re almost certain to encounter Linux. Whether you’re a Windows user who needs to collaborate with Linux systems, a cloud or mobile developer, or an IT professional seeking new career opportunities, learning Linux is more relevant than ever.

### What Makes Linux Great?

If someone asks, “Why is Linux so special?” here are a few standout reasons:

1. **Open Source Software**  
    Linux is completely open source, meaning the entire system’s source code is visible, modifiable, and redistributable. This transparency encourages rapid innovation, as developers worldwide can contribute improvements and share them freely.
    
2. **Robust Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
    Linux’s design philosophy centers on using a powerful CLI for system administration tasks. This not only makes automation, deployment, and provisioning simpler, but also provides consistency and stability—local or remote.
    
3. **Modular Design**  
    Since Linux is modular, you can replace or remove components as needed. A single Linux system can serve as both a general-purpose workstation or a highly specialized software appliance.

## What Is Open Source Software?

**Open source software** comes with its **source code** fully accessible. Anyone can view, modify, and share it under the terms of its open source license. By contrast, **proprietary (closed source)** software does not make its source code publicly available, typically limiting users to running binaries without the freedom to alter or redistribute the code.

### Benefits of Open Source

- **Control**: Examine how the software works and customize it to your needs.
- **Training**: Learn from real-world examples and build new applications.
- **Security**: Inspect the code for vulnerabilities and fix them, even if the original developers cannot.
- **Stability**: Trust that the code will outlive its original creators or maintainers.

### Types of Open Source Licenses

Open source software developers can choose from a variety of license types, but two broad categories are particularly significant:

1. **Copyleft Licenses**  
    Also known as share-alike licenses, copyleft (like the GNU General Public License, GPL) ensures that any redistributed versions—including modifications—must remain open source. This approach helps maintain the open, collaborative nature of software projects.
    
2. **Permissive Licenses**  
    Permissive licenses (like MIT, BSD, or Apache 2.0) allow developers to reuse the code more freely, even in proprietary software, as long as certain conditions (such as preserving license notices) are met. This flexibility can encourage broad adoption, though it may also allow proprietary forks.
    

### Who Develops Open Source Software?

Nowadays, most open source software is professionally developed by engineers and organizations that rely on and contribute to open source communities. Volunteers and academic institutions continue to play a key role, especially in shaping emerging technologies.

## What Is a Linux Distribution?

A **Linux distribution** (distro) bundles the Linux kernel with supporting programs, libraries, and installer tools to form a complete operating system. In 1991, Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel under the open source GPL license. Early adopters combined it with GNU Project tools, the X Window System, and other open source utilities to create full-fledged Linux distros.

### Common Traits of Linux Distributions

- They include the Linux kernel plus user-space applications.
- They can range from small, minimal systems to vast collections of software.
- They offer mechanisms to install, update, and manage software.
- They usually provide a support model, often contributing back to the upstream community.

## Who Is Red Hat?

Red Hat is the leading provider of enterprise-grade open source solutions, spanning Linux, middleware, virtualization, storage, cloud environments, and more. Red Hat’s mission is to drive better technology through open source collaboration and innovation.

- **Key Roles of Red Hat**
    - Connect customers, community contributors, and partners, ensuring effective use of open source solutions.
    - Actively participate in open source communities, contributing code and resources to countless projects.
    - Provide commercial support and services for its enterprise customers.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Ecosystem

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is Red Hat’s commercially supported, production-grade Linux distribution. Red Hat follows a multistage approach to develop RHEL:

1. **Participation**: Red Hat engages with numerous upstream open source projects.
2. **Integration**: Red Hat sponsors the Fedora project, which acts as a community-driven lab for testing and refining new features.
3. **Stabilization**: Code proven in Fedora moves to CentOS Stream, where it undergoes further hardening before becoming part of RHEL.

### Fedora

Fedora is a free, community-centric Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat. It emphasizes rapid innovation and often releases significant updates every six months. Fedora is ideal for those who want to experience cutting-edge software, but it receives shorter-term support (around a year) compared to enterprise distributions. Features introduced in Fedora are polished over time before eventually migrating into CentOS Stream and then RHEL.

### Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)

EPEL is a community-maintained repository providing additional packages for Enterprise Linux distributions. Although EPEL is closely associated with Fedora, it’s not formally supported by Red Hat. Packages here are built to work with RHEL releases, or in some cases with CentOS Stream, providing more software choices without official Red Hat support.

### CentOS Stream

CentOS Stream is the upstream development branch for RHEL. It’s a rolling-release style distribution that showcases code intended for the next version of RHEL, allowing community users to test, fix bugs, and contribute patches. This new model accelerates updates and security fixes while encouraging broader community collaboration.

> **Note**  
> Historically, CentOS Linux was a freely available rebuild of RHEL, released after each major RHEL version. However, this approach sometimes caused delays in rolling out critical updates. By switching to the CentOS Stream model, Red Hat now provides a more transparent and timely path for code contributions and faster security patch distribution across the entire ecosystem.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

**Red Hat Enterprise Linux** is the commercially supported, production-ready distribution derived from CentOS Stream. Known industry-wide as a leading enterprise platform, RHEL provides robust certification, extensive technical documentation, expert support, and multi-year stability guarantees.

Red Hat follows a subscription model for RHEL, but does not charge any licensing fees for the open source software itself. Instead, the subscription covers support, security patches, updates, and access to Red Hat’s extensive Knowledgebase, tooling, and training resources.

#### Fedora vs. CentOS Stream vs. RHEL

||Fedora|CentOS Stream|RHEL|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Expected lifecycle**|12-18 months|5 years|10 years|
|**Vendor certified?**|No|Usually not|Yes|
|**Documentation**|Community|Community|Red Hat|
|**Expert support**|No|No|Yes|
|**Dedicated security team**|No|No|Yes|
|**Security certifications**|No|No|Yes|
|**No-cost options**|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|**Management tools**|No|No|Yes|

### RHEL for Edge

RHEL for Edge is an image-based variation of RHEL that simplifies creating, deploying, and managing tailored OS images—particularly for edge computing scenarios. With Image Builder, IT teams can build minimal, targeted, and easily maintainable images. Features like zero-touch provisioning and centralized monitoring help securely manage edge deployments from a single interface.

### Red Hat CoreOS (RHCOS)

Red Hat CoreOS is integral to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP). Built from RHEL components, RHCOS is an image-based container host optimized for running Kubernetes workloads. It uses the CRI-O container runtime and is managed entirely through OpenShift tooling. Learning about containers and OpenShift is the key to understanding RHCOS.

### Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)

A Universal Base Image (UBI) is a freely redistributable subset of RHEL, tailored for container-based application development. UBIs include both minimal base images and application images (for Python, Ruby, Node.js, etc.), enabling developers to build containerized apps without needing a full RHEL subscription. Deployed on Red Hat-supported platforms like OpenShift or RHEL, UBIs receive updates in line with standard RHEL channels.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux Continuous Development

In the upstream Fedora community, **Fedora Rawhide** is where new software is constantly integrated, tested, and prepared for future Fedora releases. When Red Hat starts working on a new RHEL major version, it selects one of these Fedora releases as the foundation for **CentOS Stream**. Packages then go through further validation and are released to CentOS Stream and the pre-release RHEL builds.

Through an iterative process of testing in CentOS Stream, Red Hat refines packages for RHEL. Once Red Hat deems them production-ready, the next RHEL minor or major version is officially released.

---

## Obtaining Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Although RHEL typically requires a paid support subscription, there are multiple ways to access RHEL and related ecosystem products, often at no cost.

- **Fedora**: Free to download at [getfedora.org](https://getfedora.org/).
- **EPEL & EPEL Next**: Additional packages for RHEL are freely available via [docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/).
- **CentOS Stream**: Free to download at [centos.org/centos-stream/](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/).

### RHEL Evaluation

You can download a time-limited **evaluation copy** of RHEL at [access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation). A free Red Hat Customer Portal account is required, granting you temporary access to updates and support.

### Red Hat Developer Subscription

For developers or individuals interested in learning RHEL, the **Red Hat Developer Program** provides a free subscription. Sign up via [developer.redhat.com](https://developer.redhat.com). This subscription includes ongoing updates, though it is primarily self-supported. It’s an excellent option for personal projects, demos, and skill-building.

### Public Cloud Platforms

Major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure) offer official RHEL images. Subscriptions can be managed through Red Hat Cloud Access, allowing for seamless hybrid or multi-cloud deployments.

### Containers

You can freely use Red Hat Universal Base Images to build containerized applications—even without a paid subscription. However, for access to the wider RHEL package set (beyond the subset included in UBI) and official support, you must run your containers on a Red Hat-supported platform such as OpenShift or RHEL itself.
