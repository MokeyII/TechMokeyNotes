[[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] is designed with security in mind, offering several features to isolate applications from the host system and minimize potential security risks. However, there are additional steps you can take to further secure [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] applications on your [[Linux|Linux]] system. Below are some best practices and tips for securing Flatpaks, including the use of Flatseal, a graphical utility for managing [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] permissions.

### Built-in Security Features of Flatpak

1. **Sandboxing**:
    
    - [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] applications run in a sandboxed environment, isolating them from the host system. This limits the application's access to system resources and user data, reducing the risk of malicious activity.
2. **Portals**:
    
    - [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] uses portals to mediate access to system resources. Portals are secure interfaces that allow applications to request access to resources like files, network, and [[Hardware|Hardware]] in a controlled manner.
3. **Permissions**:
    
    - [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] applications declare their required permissions, which are reviewed and granted by the user during installation. This ensures that applications only have access to the resources they need.

### Best Practices for Securing Flatpaks

-  **Review Permissions**:
    
    - Before installing a [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] application, review the permissions it requests. You can view the permissions using the `[[Flatpak]] info` command.
    
    ```bash
    flatpak info --show-permissions <application-id>
    ```
    
    - Example:
    
    ```bash
    flatpak info --show-permissions org.gimp.GIMP
    ```
    
-  **Limit Permissions**:
    
    - You can limit the permissions of installed Flatpak applications using the `flatpak override` command. This allows you to restrict access to certain resources.
    
    ```bash
    flatpak override <application-id> --nofilesystem=home
    ```
    
    - Example: Restrict GIMP from accessing the home directory.
    
    ```bash
    flatpak override org.gimp.GIMP --nofilesystem=home
    ```
    
-  **Use Flatseal**:
    
    - Flatseal is a graphical utility that allows you to manage [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] permissions easily. You can install Flatseal from Flathub.
    
    ```bash
    flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal
    ```
    
    - Launch Flatseal and use it to review and modify the permissions of your installed [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] applications.
-  **Keep Flatpaks Updated**:
    
    - Regularly update your [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] applications to ensure you have the latest security patches and improvements.
    
    ```bash
    flatpak update
    ```
    
-  **Install from Trusted Sources**:
    
    - Only install [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] applications from trusted sources like Flathub or official repositories. Avoid installing applications from unknown or untrusted repositories.
-  **Use System Policies**:
    
    - You can define system-wide policies for [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]] applications using the `/etc/flatpak/policy` directory. This allows you to enforce security policies for all users on the system.

### Example: Securing a Flatpak Application with Flatseal
