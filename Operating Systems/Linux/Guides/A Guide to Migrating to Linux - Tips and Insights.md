# Intro
So when it comes to migrating  to Linux. There are some things you need to think about.  So let's talk about Some things to help you on your way.

# Don't get discouraged, It's actually really easy.
Linux is actually silly easy right now. 10 Years ago, there's no way I would make this claim. Linux used to be nearly all terminal use. But now, you can pretty much operate Linux with a nice Desktop Environment (DE) that is a GUI interface just like Windows. Heck, you can even make it look like Windows if you want with some distributions  such as Kubuntu, Linux Mint, any KDE Plasma DE, the list goes on.
# Choosing a Distribution aka. "Distro".

> [!HELP]
> "There are so many distributions to choose from. Which do I choose?"

True, there are soooo many. Here's a list of some Distros to make you ponder your options:

## Don't Worry, Distributions Are Just Brands.
When choosing a distro Just remember each distro is just a brand for the same thing. I read an article earlier and it stated that you should look at distros like shoes. 
For instance, Your looking for new running shoes, you would look up brands like Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc. At the end of the day, they are all just shoes. But each of these shoes offer some sort of variation, such as weights, purposes, looks, or some feature(s) that may interest you.
Each distro can be looked at almost the exact same way. Different looks, different tools, different purposes. But at the end of the day. They are all just operating systems. It's really your preference. And you'll never settle on a single one until you become a die hard fan of it.
## Desktop Environments
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/)
- [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/)
- [Cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(desktop_environment))
- [Mate](https://mate-desktop.org/)
- [Enlightentenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/)
- [Xfce](https://xfce.org/)
- [LXQt](https://lxqt-project.org/)
- [Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/)
- [LXDE](https://www.lxde.org/)
- and many more...
AHHHHHHHHHHHH! This is getting so confusing.

Don't think of these options as a negative. Yes, you are getting a lot of information and probably have no idea what to choose. But that's the beauty of migrating to Linux. You actually have options. From different web browsers, email apps, office suites, and graphic editors. If you can think of it, there's something for you and you can swap these on the fly to find a base that suits you best. 

# Opensource? Isn't this bad?
 At first glance, Opensource sounds like a bad thing. But when you actually look into it. It's really a great thing. Most code is placed in a repository for everyone to look at. You're brain is probably thinking Oh no, a hacker can look at it. But remember, **EVERYONE** can look at it. Including the people who use the OS as a daily driver and don't want it compromised. The game of security is always going to be a game of cat and mouse, but rather than the responsibility to be in the hands of developers of the OS. It's now in the hands of everyone who develops the OS, uses the OS, or people who just simply have an interest in development of the OS.

How Opensource Works (Diagram)
![[Opensource_how.png|550]]

But it's this opensource that does something that OS providers such as Windows, MAC, Google do not provide and that's general help.

There are numerous sites, discords, social groups and Reddit posts that support all Linux distros. It's actually crazy to see the amount of people willing to help. There's different approaches to every problem and one thing I love the most about the Linux community is that you don't get told "Buy a better graphics card" because whatever reason. The Linux community will generally try to push what you can do or make it better. I like going to the distro's discord and asking for help there. It's pretty handy.

# Expectations
You should be aware of some expectations when switching to Linux. Not everything is a frilly field of flowers.
You will need to understand, most of you have either dabbled in Linux or maybe not even touched it at all. Have the expectations that you will not know everything. And your month may take some time to get accustomed to Linux. This is normal for almost everyone. 

## Hardware and Peripherals 
Some hardware and peripherals just won't work or be fully supported for Linux. While some distros support hardware, others do not. You can search if your hardware is supported based on the distro or if you run into problems join your distro's discord/slack or what ever else they use for communication.

I've not ran into much issue with this. But the issue I did run into was mainly Logitech Software for managing my keyboard macros and G13 keypad. 
## Software
There are some issues with some software or even the lack of support for specific software. Such as Adobe Photoshop. There is 0 support for Photoshop on Linux.  I mean, you can use GIMP. But it's not Photoshop and is not a direct replacement for it.
If you're into 3D printing and use Fusion 360. This can work, but it will take a bit of tinkering in most cases. Outside of that, you just have to think differently. There are near 1:1 replacements for most apps. And in some cases, even better apps. You'll have to rewire that brain a little bit. I mean, you've probably used the same OS since you were born into the world and have beat the same app over and over :D.

### Flatpaks
Ohh man, this is my favorite thing about Linux. Flatpak runs off a repo called [Flathub](https://flathub.org/). Flatpaks are simply a container wrapped with all it's dependencies needed for the application. 
Check out the [setup guides](https://flathub.org/setup) for the distro you've picked.
### Software Alternatives
Take a look at my [[Comprehensive List of Linux Applications]] list for some alternatives for your needs. Some even work on other Operating Systems. You may find a diamond in the rough.

## Gaming
You'll need to understand what to expect when it comes to gaming. 
Utilize sites like [Are We Anti-Cheat Yet?](https://areweanticheatyet.com/) to see if your game is Linux Compatible. You may find some information if you have issues running steam games by looking at [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/).

With ProtonDB being mentioned, You will have to run a few games on proton in steam.
![[Pasted image 20241009121657.png|550]]
And you may need to have launch options for the game such as `PROTON_USE_EAC_LINUX=1` for those pesky EAC linux punishers or `mangohud gamemoderun %command%` for a FPS counter and utilization.

![[Pasted image 20241009121740.png|550]]
Games such as League of Legends, Destiny, and Roblox do not support Linux nor do they seem to want to even approach supporting Linux. There are some work arounds. The most controversial is a Roblox launcher, **Sober**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sober is not opensource, so use at your own risk.

## NVIDIA Users
![[Pasted image 20241009123725.png|225]]
So NVIDIA has been a bit of an issue for some time, however NVIDIA has started releasing their proprietary drivers recently. So NVIDIA support is only going to get better. However, with RPM Fusion, you can install these.
See [[Install NVIDIA Drivers and Codecs On First Boot (Fedora)]] as an example.
# So how do I prepare?
## Back up your data
Choose a place to back your data up. You can simply use a cloud source like Google drive if you choose to. Go old school and back it all up on a local drive. Or you could build your own NAS and store it all there.
## Pick the Distro YOU Want
When you're on Linux at first you will be slammed with available Distros. Remember, they are like shoes. I recommend to stay with a single distro for 2 weeks to a month. See if you like it. If so, stick with it. If you want to explore, then go choose a different one.
 Just keep in mind, mileage will vary and commands associated with each distro may change. But you can always choose a distro within the same wheelhouse that you are using so this doesn't happen. 
## Choose your Desktop Environment
It's your OS. Not your friends. Get used to the fact you own it and not someone else. So get used to this. IMO, use Gnome for simplicity. Use KDE for customizations. 
## Applications
Do a little research, figure out the applications that are supported and those that are not. Look for some alternatives and see if they will support your workflow. Make a list. When you come into Linux, get ready for it.
# Have at it.
Go, be a Linux User. Have fun with it. Explore the options you have with Linux. Ask the communities for help. Learn what being open source really means. 
## Challenge
Stick with a single Distro for 3 months then switch to another distro for 3 months. After those six months, compare how you initially thought about Linux to how you now think about Linux.
# What does Mokey use?
I use [[Fedora Workstation]]. I flop around between the [[Customizing and Using GNOME - A Comprehensive Guide]] and [[Exploring KDE Plasma - Features and Customization]] desktop environments. This just depends on my mood. But I also work on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - A Cornerstone for Enterprises]] throughout the day for work. So it transitions well.
