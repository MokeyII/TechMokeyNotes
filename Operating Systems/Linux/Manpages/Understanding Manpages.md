# Understanding Manpages
A manpage (short for "manual page") is a form of Software documentation found on Unix and Unix-like Operating Systems. Manpages provide detailed information about commands, system calls, library functions, file formats, and other aspects of the system. They are accessed using the `man` command in the terminal.

```
The table below shows the section numbers of the manual fol‐
       lowed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous  (including  macro  packages  and  conven‐
           tions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]
```

To view a manpage, you can use the `man` command followed by the name of the command or function you want to learn about. For example, `man ls` will display the manpage for the `ls` command.
See: [[Manpage ls]]
