GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) or "Guh-nome" as some people like to call it. is a popular desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes a wide range of applications, tools, and libraries to offer a cohesive and user-friendly experience. Here are some key points about GNOME:

1. **User Interface**: GNOME is known for its clean and modern user interface, which emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It uses the GNOME Shell as its main interface, which includes a top bar, an activities overview, and a dock for launching and managing applications.
2. **Applications**: GNOME comes with a suite of core applications designed to cover most basic computing needs, such as a file manager (Nautilus), a web browser (Epiphany), a text editor (Gedit), and more.
3. **Customization**: While GNOME aims for simplicity, it also allows for customization through extensions and themes. Users can install GNOME Shell extensions to add new features or modify existing ones.
4. **Accessibility**: GNOME includes a range of accessibility features to assist users with disabilities, such as screen readers, magnifiers, and keyboard accessibility options.
5. **Development**: GNOME is developed by the GNOME Project, which is part of the larger GNU Project. It is open-source and free to use, with contributions from a global community of developers.
6. **Compatibility**: GNOME is available on many Linux distributions, including [[Fedora|Fedora]], Ubuntu (with the GNOME edition), Debian, and others. It can also be installed on other Unix-like systems.
7. **Release Cycle**: GNOME follows a regular release cycle, with major updates typically released every six months. These updates bring new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
8. **Technologies**: GNOME is built using various technologies, including GTK (GIMP Toolkit) for the graphical interface, GStreamer for multimedia, and D-Bus for inter-process communication.

Overall, GNOME is a widely-used and well-regarded desktop environment that aims to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience for Linux users.

# Customizing GNOME

## GNOME Tweaks
GNOME Tweaks, often referred to simply as "Tweaks," is a utility for the GNOME desktop environment that allows users to modify and customize various aspects of their GNOME experience that are not available through the standard Settings application. It provides a more granular level of control over the desktop environment, enabling users to fine-tune their system to better suit their preferences. Here are some key features and functionalities of GNOME Tweaks:

1. **Appearance**:
   - **Themes**: Change the appearance of the desktop by selecting different themes for applications, icons, and the GNOME Shell.
   - **Fonts**: Adjust font settings, including the default font, document font, monospace font, and font scaling factor.
2. **Extensions**:
   - Manage GNOME Shell extensions, enabling or disabling them as needed. Extensions can add new features or modify existing ones to enhance the desktop experience
3. **Keyboard & Mouse**:
   - Customize Keyboard shortcuts and behavior, such as key repeat settings and the Caps Lock key function.
   - Adjust mouse and touchpad settings, including pointer speed and natural scrolling.
4. **Startup Applications**:
   - Manage applications that start automatically when you log in to your GNOME session.
5. **Top Bar**:
   - Modify the appearance and behavior of the top bar, including showing or hiding the battery percentage, date, and seconds in the clock.
6. **Windows**:
   - Configure window behavior, such as focus mode (click to focus or focus follows mouse), window snapping, and edge tiling.
7. **Workspaces**:
   - Customize workspace settings, including the number of workspaces and whether they are dynamic or static.
8. **Power**:

10. **Miscellaneous**:
    - Various other settings, such as enabling or disabling animations, configuring the default web browser, and more.

GNOME Tweaks is an essential tool for users who want to go beyond the basic customization options provided by the standard GNOME Settings application. It is typically available in the software repositories of most [[Linux|Linux]] distributions that use GNOME, and it can be installed using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it using the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
```

Once installed, you can launch GNOME Tweaks from the application menu and start customizing your GNOME desktop environment to your liking.
## GNOME Extensions
GNOME Extensions are small pieces of code that enhance or modify the functionality of the GNOME Shell, the core user interface of the GNOME desktop environment. These extensions allow users to customize their desktop experience by adding new features, changing the behavior of existing features, or altering the appearance of the GNOME Shell. Here are some key points about GNOME Extensions:

1. **Functionality**:
    - **Customization**: Extensions can change the look and feel of the GNOME Shell, such as modifying the top bar, adding new menus, or changing the behavior of the Activities Overview.
    - **Productivity**: Extensions can add productivity features like task managers, clipboard managers, system monitors, and more.
    - **Integration**: Some extensions provide better integration with third-party services or applications, such as weather forecasts, media controls, or messaging notifications.
2. **Installation**:
    - **GNOME Extensions Website**: The primary source for GNOME Extensions is the GNOME Extensions website ([https://extensions.gnome.org/](https://extensions.gnome.org/)). Users can browse, install, and manage extensions directly from the website using a web browser.
    - **GNOME Tweaks**: Installed extensions can be managed through the GNOME Tweaks tool, where users can enable, disable, or configure extensions.
    - **[[Understanding Linux Package Managers|Understanding Linux Package Managers]]**: Some extensions are available through the [[Understanding Linux Package Managers|Understanding Linux Package Managers]] of various [[Linux|Linux]] distributions.
3. **Management**:
