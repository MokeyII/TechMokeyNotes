CentOS Stream 9 is a [[Linux]] distribution that serves as a rolling-release version of CentOS, which itself is derived from the sources of [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - A Cornerstone for Enterprises]]. CentOS Stream acts as a development platform that sits between [[Fedora]] (a cutting-edge, community-driven distribution) and [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - A Cornerstone for Enterprises]] (a stable, enterprise-grade distribution). Here are some key points about CentOS Stream 9:

1. **Development Platform**: CentOS Stream 9 is designed to be a continuously delivered distribution that provides a preview of the next minor release of [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - A Cornerstone for Enterprises]]. It allows developers and users to see what is coming in future RHEL releases and contribute to its development.
    
2. **Rolling Release**: Unlike traditional CentOS versions that are based on specific RHEL releases, CentOS Stream is a rolling release. This means it receives continuous updates and improvements, providing a more dynamic and up-to-date environment.
    
3. **Community and Contributions**: CentOS Stream encourages community contributions. Developers can submit patches, report bugs, and participate in the development process, influencing the future of RHEL.
    
4. **Alignment with RHEL**: CentOS Stream 9 is closely aligned with RHEL 9. It provides a testing ground for features and updates that will eventually be included in RHEL 9.x minor releases.
    
5. **Use Cases**: CentOS Stream 9 is suitable for developers who want to stay on the cutting edge of RHEL development, as well as for organizations that want to test their applications and infrastructure against the latest updates before they are officially released in RHEL.
    
6. **Support and Stability**: While CentOS Stream is more dynamic than traditional CentOS, it still aims to maintain a high level of stability and reliability, making it a viable option for development and testing environments.
    

In summary, CentOS Stream 9 is a forward-looking, continuously updated Linux distribution that bridges the gap between Fedora and RHEL, providing a platform for development, testing, and community contributions.
