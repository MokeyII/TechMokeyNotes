# YAY
`yay` (Yet Another Yaourt) is a command-line utility designed for Arch Linux and its derivatives, including EndeavourOS. It serves as an AUR (Arch User Repository) helper, streamlining the process of searching for, installing, and managing packages from both the official repositories and the AUR. By automating tasks such as dependency resolution and package compilation, `yay` enhances the user experience in maintaining an Arch-based system.
