**[Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)** is a custom [[Linux]] image based on [[Fedora]] [[Fedora Kinoite]], that brings the best of Linux gaming to all of your devices - including your favorite handheld.. However, Bazzite also includes a GNOME Desktop Environment (DE) option, providing flexibility for users who prefer either KDE Plasma or GNOME. Bazzite is the next generation of Linux Gaming. 

Bazzite has received great reviews for their functionality with devices such as the ROG Ally. During the time of writing this document, even I have been using Bazzite for the past 2 weeks and it has really been an out of the box pleasant experience. Sure, I had to learn OSTree compared to my normal DNF life :D 

In my opinion, if you're just wanting to want to get rid of all of the crap and just game or just want a like built OS for your ROG Ally, Steam Deck and PC. This is the image for you.

I have only encountered one issue and that was during the installer which produced an error installing the RazerGenie. Which I just installed after the fact anyways. Additionally, I've even talked my brother into running Bazzite with ZERO experience in Linux and he's having just as much fun gaming as I am.

I give Kudos to Bazzite. Keep it up!

Now time for the nitty gritty.
### Key Features of Bazzite:

1. **KDE Plasma and GNOME Desktop Environments**: Bazzite offers both KDE Plasma and GNOME desktop environments, allowing users to choose their preferred interface. KDE Plasma is known for its flexibility and customization options, while GNOME offers a clean and modern user experience.
2. **Immutable Base**: Like Fedora Kinoite, Bazzite is built on an immutable base, meaning the core system files are read-only. This provides a stable and consistent environment that is resistant to accidental changes and corruption.
3. **Pre-configured Setup**: Bazzite comes with various pre-installed software and configurations to enhance the user experience specifically for gaming. This includes an installer upon setup with a plethora of options to really customize your OS to your liking.
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: The customizations and optimizations in Bazzite aim to provide a more polished and user-friendly experience out of the box.
5. **Consistency and Reliability**: The immutable nature of the system ensures that it remains consistent and reliable over time, making it an excellent choice for both developers and regular users.
