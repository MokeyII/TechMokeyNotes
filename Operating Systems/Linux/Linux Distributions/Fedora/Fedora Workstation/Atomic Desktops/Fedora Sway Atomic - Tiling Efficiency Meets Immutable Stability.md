"Sway Atomic" for [[Fedora]] refers to a variant of the Fedora operating system that combines the Sway tiling window manager with the immutable and atomic update features of Fedora [[Fedora Silverblue - Immutable and Container-Friendly]]. This setup aims to provide a stable, reliable, and efficient desktop environment tailored for users who prefer the Sway window manager's tiling capabilities.

Here are some key aspects of Sway Atomic for Fedora:

1. **Immutable Filesystem**: Like Fedora [[Fedora Silverblue - Immutable and Container-Friendly]], Sway Atomic features an immutable filesystem. This means the core system files are read-only, enhancing security and stability by preventing unauthorized or accidental changes.
    
2. **Atomic Updates**: Updates are applied atomically, ensuring that the system is either fully updated or remains in its previous state. This reduces the risk of partial updates causing system instability and allows for easy rollback if an update fails.
    
3. **Sway Window Manager**: Sway is a tiling window manager for Wayland, designed to be a drop-in replacement for the i3 window manager. It provides a highly configurable and efficient way to manage windows, making it ideal for power users and developers who prefer a tiling workflow.
    
4. **Container-Based Workflows**: Similar to Fedora [[Fedora Silverblue - Immutable and Container-Friendly]], Sway Atomic supports containerized applications using tools like Podman and [[Flatpak - A Universal Packaging System for Linux]]. This allows users to run applications in isolated environments, further enhancing system stability and security.
    
5. **OSTree**: The system uses OSTree for managing updates and versioning. OSTree allows for the deployment and management of bootable, immutable filesystem trees, making it easier to handle system updates and rollbacks.
    
6. **Consistency Across Environments**: The immutable nature of Sway Atomic ensures that the system environment remains consistent across different machines, making it ideal for developers who need a stable and reproducible environment.
    
7. **Customization and Flexibility**: While the core system is immutable, users can layer additional packages on top of the base system if needed. These layered packages are managed separately and do not affect the core system's stability.
    

Sway Atomic for Fedora is particularly well-suited for users who prefer the Sway window manager's tiling capabilities and want the benefits of an immutable, atomic-update-based system. It combines the best of both worlds, offering a stable and efficient desktop environment with the flexibility and power of Sway.
