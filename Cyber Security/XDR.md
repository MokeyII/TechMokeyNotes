# Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
XDR offers a more integrated and automated approach to threat detection and response. It offers: 
- Automated threat detection capabilities
- Streamlined security operations
- Reduced response times
- Improved security posture
# How it Works 
XDR aggregates data from various security layers such as endpoints, networks and cloud environments. It utilizes AI to analyze the data provided in real time, identifying patterns and anomalies that indicate threats.
