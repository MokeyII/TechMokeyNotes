# Identity Management (IdM)

Identity Management refers to the processes, policies, and technologies used to manage digital identities. It involves the creation, maintenance, and deletion of user accounts and their associated access rights within an organization or system. The primary goals of identity management are to ensure that the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times for the right reasons.

Key components of Identity Management include:

- **User Provisioning and De-provisioning**: Creating and deleting user accounts and managing their access rights.
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a system.
- **Authorization**: Determining what resources a user can access and what actions they can perform.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allowing users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without needing to log in again.
- **Password Management**: Handling password policies, resets, and recovery.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigning permissions to users based on their role within an organization.
Identity Management and [[Identity Providers]] (IDPs) work together to streamline and secure the process of managing user identities and access to resources.
