# Identity Providers (IDPs)
An Identity Provider (IDP) is a service or system that creates, maintains, and manages identity information while providing authentication services to applications. IDPs are a critical component of federated [[Identity Management]], where a user's identity is managed by a trusted third party rather than each individual application or service.

Key functions of an IDP include:

- **Authentication Services**: Verifying user credentials and providing authentication tokens.
- **Federated [[Identity Management]]**: Allowing users to use a single identity across multiple systems or organizations.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enabling users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
- **Identity Federation Protocols**: Supporting standards like SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OAuth, and OpenID Connect to facilitate secure identity sharing across domains.

Popular IDPs include services like Google Identity, Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Okta, and Auth0. These services help organizations manage user identities and streamline access to various applications and services, enhancing security and user convenience.

[[Identity Management]] and Identity Providers (IDPs) work together to streamline and secure the process of managing user identities and access to resources.
## 1. **User Registration and Identity Creation**

- **Identity Management**: When a new user needs access to an organization's resources, the identity management system is responsible for creating a digital identity for that user. This involves collecting necessary information, assigning roles, and setting up credentials.
- **IDP Role**: The IDP may be involved in the initial registration process, especially if it supports self-service registration or integrates with external identity sources (e.g., social login).

## 2. **Authentication**

- **Identity Management**: Ensures that users are authenticated before accessing resources. This involves verifying the user's credentials (e.g., username and password).
- **IDP Role**: The IDP handles the authentication process. When a user attempts to log in, the IDP verifies their credentials and, upon successful authentication, issues an authentication token or assertion.

## 3. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**

- **Identity Management**: Facilitates SSO to improve user experience by allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.
- **IDP Role**: The IDP provides SSO capabilities by issuing tokens that can be used to authenticate the user across different applications. This is often done using protocols like SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect.

## 4. **Authorization and Access Control**

- **Identity Management**: Determines what resources a user can access based on their roles and permissions.
- **IDP Role**: While the IDP primarily handles authentication, it can also pass along user attributes and roles to applications, which can then use this information to enforce access control policies.

## 5. **Federated Identity Management**

- **Identity Management**: Supports federated identity by allowing users to access resources across different domains or organizations using a single identity.
- **IDP Role**: The IDP acts as a trusted authority that can authenticate users across different domains. It facilitates identity federation by supporting standards like SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect, allowing users to access external services without needing separate credentials.

## 6. **User Provisioning and De-provisioning**

- **Identity Management**: Manages the lifecycle of user identities, including creating, updating, and deleting accounts as needed.
- **IDP Role**: The IDP can automate provisioning and de-provisioning processes by integrating with directory services and applications, ensuring that user access is updated in real-time.

## 7. **Audit and Compliance**

- **Identity Management**: Tracks and logs user activities to ensure compliance with security policies and regulations.
- **IDP Role**: Provides detailed logs of authentication events and can integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for comprehensive auditing.
