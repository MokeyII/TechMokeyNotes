## About Me (Mokey)

With over 16 years of extensive experience in the IT industry, I have honed my skills across a broad spectrum of roles including Help Desk, Programming, Database Management, Systems Administration, Cyber Security, and Network Management. My journey in technology has been both diverse and enriching, allowing me to develop a deep understanding of various IT domains and their interconnections.

My professional path began with fiddling and having an aptitude to learn. I delved into Programming and Database Management, gaining proficiency in creating and maintaining robust software solutions and data architectures. Along with that I learned a lot about computer hardware and worked in a IT Help Desk Environment, where I developed a strong customer service ethic and problem-solving skills.  My expertise further expanded into Systems Administration and Cyber Security, where I managed complex IT infrastructures and implemented advanced security measures to protect organizational assets. In which now I manage networks and apply my knowledge to all I.T. areas.

In addition to my civilian career, I proudly served in the Army National Guard as a 12B - Combat Engineer and 12W - Carpentry and Masonry Specialist. During my deployment in Iraq, I leveraged my technical skills to set up Local Area Networks (LANs) for gaming, providing a much-needed morale boost for my fellow soldiers. This experience not only enhanced my technical capabilities but also instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, teamwork, and resilience.

A staunch advocate for open-source technologies, I have a particular preference for Linux over Windows. I appreciate Linux for its flexibility, security, and the powerful command-line interface it offers, which aligns perfectly with my passion for scripting and automation. 

My educational background in mechanical and architectural drafting and design has provided me with a unique perspective on problem-solving and system design. This multidisciplinary knowledge allows me to approach IT challenges with a creative and analytical mindset, ensuring comprehensive and innovative solutions. 

Throughout my career, I have remained committed to continuous learning and professional development. I am passionate about staying ahead of emerging technologies and trends, and I strive to apply this knowledge to drive innovation and excellence in every project I undertake. Additionally as a CEO and a CTO of two companies, I've learned many different approaches to any solution.
